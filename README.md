📌 Project Title: Site Selection for Renewable Energy Using GIS and Multi-Criteria Decision Making
🔍 Overview
This project aims to optimize the site selection process for renewable energy projects, leveraging geospatial datasets and Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques.
The work is inspired by research published in Nature Scientific  and various other studies analyzing wind and solar energy potential.

🛠 Features
Uses GIS-based analysis for site selection.
Incorporates datasets from Copernicus, OpenStreetMap, Global Wind Atlas, and Global Solar Atlas.
Applies Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) for ranking potential sites.
Supports decision-making for sustainable energy planning.

📂 Datasets Used
The project relies on publicly available and high-resolution geospatial datasets, including:

Global Dataset – Climate, land use, and infrastructure data.

Copernicus Dataset – European geospatial data.

OpenStreetMap (OSM) – Roads, power grids, and urban infrastructure.

Global Solar Data – Solar irradiation and photovoltaic potential.

Global Wind Data – Wind speeds and wind power density.
